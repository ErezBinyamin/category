<p>Goal: If there are three numbers <cat-math>a</cat-math>, <cat-math>b</cat-math>, <cat-math>c</cat-math> that we know and an unknown <cat-math>x</cat-math> where <cat-math>a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0</cat-math>. Given this relationship, we want to deduce the value of <cat-math>x</cat-math> in terms of <cat-math>a</cat-math>, <cat-math>b</cat-math>, and <cat-math>c</cat-math>.</p>
<p>The quadratic formula says that as long as <cat-math>a</cat-math> isn’t zero, we the two values of <cat-math>x</cat-math> that will satisfy this equation are:</p>
<p><cat-math>x = fraction(-b+squareroot(b^2-4*a*c), 2a)</cat-math> and <cat-math>x = fraction(-b-squareroot(b^2-4*a*c), 2a)</cat-math></p>
<p>(If <cat-math>a</cat-math> is zero, and <cat-math>b</cat-math> is non-zero, this is just a linear equation, and <cat-math>x = -fraction(c, b)</cat-math> is the simple answer. If <cat-math>a</cat-math> and <cat-math>b</cat-math> are both zero, then there’s no actual <cat-math>x</cat-math> to solve for, and either <cat-math>c</cat-math> is zero and the equation is true regardless of <cat-math>x</cat-math>’s value or <cat-math>c</cat-math> is not zero and no value of <cat-math>x</cat-math> can make the equation true.)</p>
