# Intro

Our main theorem is

[loc](is statement of: theorem 1)

**Theorem:** A = B

We will prove this in section 2. 

# Section 1

[loc](is definition of: object 1)

**Definition:** A = 1

[loc](is definition of: object 2)

**Definition:** B = 1

# Section 2

We can now prove theorem 1

[loc](is proof of: theorem 1; is use of: object 1; is use of: object 2)

**Proof of theorem 1:** A = 1, 1 = 1, 1 = B, therefore A = B
