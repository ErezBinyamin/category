name: The Quadratic Formula
```

Goal: If there are three numbers $a$, $b$, $c$ that we know and an
unknown $x$ where $a*x^2 + b*x + c = 0$. Given this relationship, we
want to deduce the value of $x$ in terms of $a$, $b$, and $c$.

The quadratic formula says that as long as $a$ isn't zero, we the two
values of $x$ that will satisfy this equation are:

$x = fraction(-b+squareroot(b^2-4*a*c), 2a)$ and $x = fraction(-b-squareroot(b^2-4*a*c), 2a)$

(If $a$ is zero, and $b$ is non-zero, this is just a linear equation,
and $x = -fraction(c, b)$ is the simple answer. If $a$ and $b$ are both
zero, then there's no actual $x$ to solve for, and either $c$ is zero
and the equation is true regardless of $x$'s value or $c$ is not zero
and no value of $x$ can make the equation true.)
